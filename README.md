APPLICATION OVERVIEW:

With the introduction of Instacart, DoorDash, and Amazon Prime, letting consumers stay at home with a service coming to them has become the new norm. This application lets customers book time slots for Vinny Van-Go to arrive at their home with stocked shelves of products for in person shopping - cutting the expensive cost of ordering the wrong materials online. This app can also be used for events like flea markets or craft fairs, much like a food truck, but for art supplies!


PRIMARY FEATURES: 

1. The user can register and login to the application with an email. 
2. The user can create a new van booking for a specific day, time, address, and have an option for an event/attendance.
3. The user can then view all current and future bookings.
4. The user can delete or cancel any bookings they no longer wish to have.
5. The user can navigate to "The Ear" a weekly updated newsletter page with material stock updates and information.
6. The user can navigate to "Gallery" where customer art can be displayed listing the materials used from Vinny Van Go, which user posted, the title of the piece and the user's email for contact information. Artwork examples are from cohort 52. 


TARGET AUDIENCE:

The target audience is anyone that is interested in purchasing materials for their art projects that cannot leave their house or prefer the functionality of a delivery service, which gives a very broad range.

1. Clone this repository 
2. cd into the directory
3. Install the necessary packages:
4. npm install
5. npm i --save react react-dom react-router-dom reactstrap

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
